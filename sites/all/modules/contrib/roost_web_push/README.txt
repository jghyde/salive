Using Features

Safari Web Push To use Safari Web Push, simply activate the Roost
for Drupal module. When your site is viewed in a push-enabled browser,
the browser will prompt for permission. No additional setup is needed.

Auto Push Auto Push is what makes this module stellar. When you create
a new post, your post's title, link, and featured image (if one is attached)
will be sent to all of your subscribed readers. That's it. Really. You don't
have to do anything else. (It works just like magic.) When enabled, an auto
push override check box is also placed on your post's admin page. If for
some reason you do not want a notification to go out for that post, just
check the box when publishing.

Send Manual Alert You can send a manual alert to all subscribed users by
entering your message text in the "Notification Text" box and a link in
the "Notification Link" box.

Activate all Roost Features When checked, your site will automatically
receive the newest (and coolest) features from Roost as we roll them
out. (Like Chrome Web Push. cough)

Roost Analytics & Roost JS Detailed metrics are provided in the dashboard.
These metrics include subscribers, notifications sent, average time on
site, and total page views.

Mobile Push Support To enable mobile push support, check the box.
The Roost Header bar, will be inserted onto your page.

Yup! Cool right?

follow. To take advantage of them as we include support, make sure to have
Activate all Roost Features checked.

If I'm using Mobile Push Support, Why do subscribers have to download the
Roost mobile app?
In order for a device to receive a true push notification, a native mobile
app must be installed. That's where Roost comes in. We are there to provide
that native bridge. We do not pull readers into our app, but push them back
to your website. Notifications also stay in the Roost app, which makes them
able to be viewed at any time.

Do my readers / subscribers have to create an account with Roost?
Nope. We have a patent-pending zero-configuration installation process for
the Roost app. When a person hits your subscription link, the are sent to
the Roost page on their device's app store, and prompted for install. Once
installed and opened, a person is sent directly back to the page they
were viewing on your site.
